# Ethereum Whitepaper {#ethereum-whitepaper}

_This introductory paper was originally published in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, the founder of [Ethereum](/what-is-ethereum/), before the project's launch in 2015. It's worth noting that Ethereum, like many community-driven, open-source software projects, has evolved since its initial inception._

_While several years old, we maintain this paper because it continues to serve as a useful reference and an accurate representation of Ethereum and its vision. To learn about the latest developments of Ethereum, and how changes to the protocol are made, we recommend [this guide](/learn/)._
